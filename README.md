CriticalMaterialsBI is a data analytics solution built on Microsoft Fabric to assess raw material risks, supplier dependencies, and risk-mitigating priorities for a fictional manufacturer. The project simulates a real-world business intelligence (BI) workflow by integrating on-premise databases, streaming data, and synthetic datasets to support strategic decision-making.

ðŸš€ Key Features
	â€¢	On-Premise Database Simulation â€“ Local SQL databases representing product, material, and supplier data.
	â€¢	Live Streaming Data â€“ Web-scraped and Python-generated price updates for key materials.
	â€¢	Critical Raw Materials Mapping â€“ Connecting supplier-purchased materials to EU-defined critical raw materials for risk assessment.
	â€¢	Supplier Risk Analytics â€“ Identifying and prioritizing risk mitigation efforts based on supply chain vulnerabilities.
	â€¢	Microsoft Fabric Integration â€“ Cloud-based analytics and reporting using Power BI and Fabric data services.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
	â€¢	Microsoft Fabric (Data Factory, Power BI, Lakehouse)
	â€¢	SQL (On-Prem Database Simulation)
	â€¢	Python (Web scraping, synthetic data generation, streaming data simulation)
	â€¢	Power BI (Dashboards & reports)

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
	â€¢	Simulate a real-world manufacturing data pipeline with on-premise and cloud analytics.
	â€¢	Provide insights into the manufacturer's supply chain risks, particularly those related to critical raw materials.
	â€¢	Demonstrate how streaming data can enhance material risk assessment and decision-making.
